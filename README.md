## Enhanced ASCII art

*AsciiPaint* can be used to produce *enhanced* [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art). *AsciiPaint* uses a console window created with the *Consoul* library to support editing and display of the drawings, so it supports additional features that the *Consoul* library implements, like using the full (displayable) unicode character set of a font and colors from a 32 bits palette, among others.
